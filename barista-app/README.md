# Purpose
You click the right most button and generate a new drink. Then, you pick what you think the ingredients for the drink are. The check answer button will tell you if you are right or not. Then, you can do it again.

# Implementation
I used many state hooks, namely useState and different variables and functions. This project has been more complicated than past onces becasue of the interactive features. I also used the if-else in jsx for the first time.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
